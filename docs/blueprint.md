# **App Name**: HelioHeggie

## Core Features:

- Weather Data Fetch: Fetches weather forecast data for the user's location from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) focusing on sun intensity/cloud cover for the current and next day.
- Energy Calculation: Calculates estimated solar energy generation based on weather data and user-defined solar panel configurations (location, direction, panel count/power, battery capacity) saved locally.
- Smart Charge Advisory: Advises users on smart battery charging based on forecasted solar generation, defined cheap tariff periods, and an algorithm that determines if charging from the grid during off-peak hours is beneficial.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Orange (#FFA500) for backgrounds and highlights.
- Secondary color: Black (#000000) for text and dark theme base.
- Accent color: Silver (#C0C0C0) for buttons and interactive elements.
- Use headers for titles and theme toggle, and footers for main menu navigation and copyright information.
- Crisp, clean icons to represent solar energy, weather conditions, and battery status.
